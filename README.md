## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Human Resource Information System (HRIS)** built using **Laravel**.

The system is designed to be **modular, scalable, and maintainable**, following clean architecture principles and enterprise-ready patterns such as:

-   Module-based structure
-   Repository pattern
-   Request validation
-   Separation of concerns

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Folder Structure

The application follows a **module-first architecture**.

```
app/
├── Http/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   │   └── {Module}/
│   │       └── {Module}Controller.php
│   ├── Requests/
│   │   └── {Module}Request.php
├── Repository/
│   └── {Module}/
│       ├── {Module}Repository.php
│       └── {Module}RepositoryInterface.php
routes/
└── api/
    └── {module}/
        └── {module}.php
```

### Example: Department Module

```
app/Http/Controllers/Department/DepartmentController.php
app/Http/Requests/DepartmentRequest.php
app/Repository/Department/DepartmentRepository.php
app/Repository/Department/DepartmentRepositoryInterface.php
routes/api/department/department.php
```

---

## 🧩 Modules

### Current / Planned Modules

-   Employee
-   Department
-   Position
-   Employment Status
-   Roles
-   Permissions
-   Audit Logs

Each module includes:

-   Controller
-   Form Request
-   Repository + Interface
-   API route file

---

## 🛠️ Custom Artisan Commands

### Create a New Module

```bash
php artisan make:module {ModuleName}
```

**Example:**

```bash
php artisan make:module Department
```

This command safely creates (only if missing):

-   Controller
-   Request
-   Repository
-   Repository Interface
-   API route file

**Note:** Existing files and folders are never overwritten.

---

## 📡 API Routing

Each module has its own API route file:

```
routes/api/{module}/{module}.php
```

**Examples:**

```
routes/api/department/department.php
routes/api/employee/employee.php
```

All module routes should be included in `routes/api.php`.

---

## 🗄️ Database & Migrations

**Run migrations:**

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

**Rollback last migration:**

```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

**Reset and re-run all migrations:**

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

-   Laravel authentication
-   Role-based access control (RBAC)
-   Roles and permissions stored in the database
-   Repositories abstract all data access

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hris
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

**Run tests:**

```bash
php artisan test
```

---

## 🧠 Development Conventions

-   Modules are isolated and self-contained
-   Controllers stay thin
-   Business logic lives in repositories/services
-   Validation is handled via Form Requests
-   API routes are organized per module
